# INTEGRATION STRATEGY

**Version:** Gold v1.0
**Location:** [GLOBAL_MEMORY.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/GLOBAL_MEMORY.md)
**Purpose:** The architectural integration map of the entire Anti-Gravity operating system. Explains how all folders, files, and layers work together as one coordinated system.

> [!NOTE]
> This is NOT a user prompt. This is NOT a loading strategy.
> This is the engineering blueprint of HOW the system interconnects.
> Read this to understand WHY the system is structured this way and HOW task execution flows across all layers.

## CORE THESIS

Anti-Gravity is not a prompt pack. It is not a collection of reference documents. It is a **layered cognitive operating system** where each layer has a distinct job and the layers work together as an integrated whole.

The system becomes powerful not when all files are loaded, but when the **right files are integrated in the right order for the right task.**

## THE 8 SYSTEM LAYERS

Each folder in [.antigravity/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/) represents a functional layer. These layers are numbered by their role in the cognitive pipeline, not by their folder position.

**LAYER 1 — PERMANENT MIND ([core/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/core/))**
The stable operating kernel. Identity, cognition, modes, process, standards. Always active. Never unloaded.
│
▼
**LAYER 2 — SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE ([skills/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/skills/))**
Domain-specific behavioral instructions. Activated by task. Changes HOW Anti-Gravity thinks in a specific domain.
│
▼
**LAYER 3 — GROUND TRUTH ([contexts/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/contexts/))**
Project-specific facts. Stack, architecture, conventions, business rules. Prevents generic advice.
│
▼
**LAYER 4 — TASK EXECUTION ([workflows/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/workflows/))**
Step-by-step execution sequences. Chains skills together. Defines WHAT to do first, next, and last.
│
▼
**LAYER 5 — OUTPUT FORMALIZATION ([templates/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/global_templates/))**
Reusable output scaffolds. Ensures consistent, complete deliverables for formal artifacts.
│
▼
**LAYER 6 — QUALITY JUDGMENT ([rubrics/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/rubric/))**
Self-assessment matrices. Evaluates whether output is strong enough BEFORE delivery.
│
▼
**LAYER 7 — IMPROVEMENT MEASUREMENT ([benchmarks/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/benchmarks/))**
Repeatable test scenarios. Measures whether the system is getting better over time.
│
▼
**LAYER 8 — INSTITUTIONAL LEARNING ([memory/](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/memory/))**
Retained knowledge. Decisions, patterns, mistakes, results, postmortems, system evolution. Compounds over time.

### Layer Characteristics

| Layer | Folder | Files | Loading Tier | Stability | Content Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `core/` | 10 | Tier 1 — Always on | Very stable | Behavioral rules |
| 2 | `skills/` | 14 | Tier 2 — By task | Stable | Domain instructions |
| 3 | `contexts/` | 12 | Tier 2 — By task | Variable | Project facts |
| 4 | `workflows/` | 11 | Tier 2 — By task | Stable | Execution sequences |
| 5 | `templates/` | 7 | Tier 3 — On demand | Stable | Output scaffolds |
| 6 | `rubrics/` | 11 | Tier 3 — On demand | Stable | Evaluation matrices |
| 7 | `benchmarks/` | 7 | Tier 4 — Evaluation only | Stable | Test scenarios |
| 8 | `memory/` | 6 | Tier 3 — On demand | Growing continuously | Accumulated knowledge |

## HOW THE LAYERS INTERACT

### The Information Flow

A TASK ARRIVES
│
▼
CORE (Layer 1) identifies:
├── Which MODE to activate ([operating-modes.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/core/operating-modes.md))
├── Which SKILLS to load ([activation-engine.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/core/activation-engine.md))
├── Which WORKFLOW to follow ([activation-engine.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/core/activation-engine.md))
├── The PROCESS to follow ([execution-workflow.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/core/execution-workflow.md))
└── The QUALITY BAR to meet ([quality-bar.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/core/quality-bar.md))
│
▼
SKILLS (Layer 2) add domain expertise:
├── Primary skill loaded (1 file)
├── Secondary skills loaded (0-2 files)
└── Skill tells Anti-Gravity HOW to think in this domain
│
▼
CONTEXTS (Layer 3) ground the work:
├── Project-specific files loaded (1-4 files)
└── Context tells Anti-Gravity WHAT specific environment to work in
│
▼
WORKFLOW (Layer 4) sequences execution:
├── One workflow loaded
├── Workflow defines the step-by-step process
├── Each step may activate different mode + skill combinations
└── Workflow includes gates ("do not proceed until...")
│
▼
EXECUTION HAPPENS (following the workflow steps)
│
▼
TEMPLATES (Layer 5) shape output if needed:
├── Loaded only during the Communicate phase
└── Only if the output is a formal deliverable
│
▼
RUBRICS (Layer 6) evaluate quality:
├── Loaded during the Critique/Verify phase
├── Self-assessment against domain-specific criteria
└── Determines: ship, fix, or revisit
│
▼
MEMORY (Layer 8) stores learning:
├── Significant decisions → [decisions-log.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/memory/decisions-log.md)
├── Useful patterns → [common-patterns.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/memory/common-patterns.md)
├── Mistakes made → [mistakes-to-avoid.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/memory/mistakes-to-avoid.md)
├── If incident → [postmortems.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/memory/postmortems.md)
└── If system changed → [version-notes.md](file:///C:/Users/Oviks/.gemini/antigravity/memory/version-notes.md)

### The Feedback Loop

The system is not linear — it has a feedback loop:
Task → Execute → Learn → Memory grows
│
▼
Next similar task → Load memory
│
▼
Better execution → Better learning
│
▼
System gets stronger over time

Without memory, every task starts from zero. With memory, every task builds on everything before.

## RUNTIME TASK ASSEMBLY

### The Assembly Protocol

When a task arrives, Anti-Gravity assembles a **runtime bundle** — the specific combination of files active for this task.

#### Step 1: Base Layer (Always Present)

ALWAYS LOADED:
└── core/ (all 10 files — via master system prompt)

#### Step 2: Task Classification

Determine:

- What MODE is this? (Architect, Builder, Debugger, etc.)
- What TYPE of task? (build feature, debug, review, etc.)
- What RISK level? (high = more files, low = fewer files)

#### Step 3: Skill Selection

LOAD:

- 1 PRIMARY skill (matches the mode)
- 0-2 SECONDARY skills (if task spans domains)

RULE: Never load more than 3 skill files.

#### Step 4: Workflow Selection

LOAD:
└── 1 workflow (matches the task type)

RULE: Never load multiple workflows simultaneously.

#### Step 5: Context Selection

LOAD:
└── 1-4 context files (relevant to the specific work)

RULE: Start with 1-2. Add more only if needed. RULE: Maximum 4 context files per task.

#### Step 6: On-Demand (During Execution)

LOAD WHEN NEEDED:

- 1 template (during Communicate phase)
- 1 rubric (during Critique phase)
- 0-2 memory files (if past decisions are relevant)

RULE: Don't pre-load these. Load at the moment of need.

### The Assembled Bundle

A typical task configuration looks like:
RUNTIME BUNDLE (Example: Build a New Feature)
│
├── CORE (always) [10 files — via system prompt]
├── PRIMARY SKILL: skill-coding [1 file]
├── SECONDARY SKILL: skill-testing [1 file]
├── WORKFLOW: workflow-build-feature [1 file]
├── CONTEXT: stack-context.md [1 file]
├── CONTEXT: architecture-context.md [1 file]
└── CONTEXT: coding-standards.md [1 file]
│
│ ... during execution ...
│
├── TEMPLATE: feature-plan.md [loaded at Phase 5]
├── RUBRIC: code-quality-rubric.md [loaded at Phase 7]
└── MEMORY: decisions-log.md [loaded if relevant]

## PRACTICAL INTEGRATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Build a Feature

**Assembly:**

| Layer | Files Loaded | When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Core | All 10 (via system prompt) | Always |
| Skills | `skill-coding`, `skill-testing` | Task start |
| Contexts | `stack-context`, `architecture-context`, `coding-standards`, `database-context` | Task start |
| Workflow | `workflow-build-feature` | Task start |
| Template | `feature-plan.md` | During scoping |
| Rubric | `code-quality-rubric.md` | During self-review |

---

### Example 2: Debug a Production Issue

**Assembly:**

| Layer | Files Loaded | When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Core | All 10 | Always |
| Skills | `skill-debugging`, `skill-security` | Task start |
| Contexts | `stack-context`, `architecture-context`, `infra-context`, `security-baselines` | Task start |
| Workflow | `workflow-debug-issue` | Task start |
| Template | `debug-report.md` | After fix |
| Rubric | `debugging-rubric.md` | Before delivery |

---

### Example 3: Start a New Project (Hackathon)

**Assembly:**

| Layer | Files Loaded | When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Core | All 9 | Always |
| Skills | `skill-product-thinking`, `skill-architecture` | Task start |
| Contexts | None initially (created during execution) | Task start |
| Workflow | `workflow-project-inception` | Task start |
| Template | `project-brief.md` | Phase 5 |
| Rubric | `project-planning-rubric.md` | After Phase 5 |

---

### Example 4: Ship to Production

**Assembly:**

| Layer | Files Loaded | When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Core | All 9 | Always |
| Skills | `skill-devops-infra`, `skill-review-audit` | Task start |
| Contexts | `infra-context`, `security-baselines`, `testing-standards` | Task start |
| Workflow | `workflow-ship-to-production` | Task start |

---

## INTEGRATION RULES

### Rule 1: Core Always Governs

No skill, context, workflow, template, or rubric should silently override the core layer. If a conflict exists, core wins.

### Rule 2: One Workflow at a Time

Multiple workflows should NOT compete simultaneously. If a task genuinely spans multiple workflow types, execute them SEQUENTIALLY.

### Rule 3: Context Should Ground, Not Flood

Load only the contexts that materially improve the current task. Maximum 4 context files per task.

### Rule 4: Skills Specialize, Core Generalizes

Skills add domain-specific behavior. They should NOT restate core principles.

### Rule 5: Templates Are Optional

Use templates when the output benefits from formal structure. Deliverables like ADRs, debug reports, and project briefs need them.

### Rule 6: Rubrics Belong Near Verification

Load rubrics during the Critique/Verify phase.

### Rule 7: Memory Is Selective

Load memory files when historical context matters. Do NOT load memory by default.

### Rule 8: Benchmarks Are Not Runtime Context

Benchmark files are evaluation tools for testing Anti-Gravity itself. They are NEVER loaded during normal task execution.

### Rule 9: README First

When entering any folder for the first time in a task, read the folder's `README.md` first.

### Rule 10: Lean Loading Beats Heavy Loading

A focused bundle of 3-5 relevant files produces better output than a bloated bundle.

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

The power of this system is not in any individual file. The power is in the **integration** — the right files, loaded in the right order, for the right task, governed by stable principles, evaluated against consistent standards, and learning from every execution.
