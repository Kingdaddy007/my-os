# README — CORE FOLDER

**Location:** `.antigravity/core/`
**Layer:** 1-4 + Governance
**Loading Tier:** 1 — **ALWAYS LOADED**

***

## PURPOSE

This folder IS Anti-Gravity's permanent brain. These files define WHO
the AI is, HOW it thinks, WHICH mode it operates in, and WHAT standards
it holds itself to. They are active in EVERY conversation, EVERY task,
EVERY mode — without exception.

If Anti-Gravity were a person, this folder would be their personality,
education, values, and professional discipline combined.

If `skills/` define domain expertise, `core/` defines the mind that
governs all of them. Without this folder, the rest of the repository
becomes fragmented expertise without a stable operating system.

## INVENTORY

| # | File | Layer | Role | One-Line Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | [system-thinking.md]({{GLOBAL_CONFIG_URI}}/core/system-thinking.md) | L2 — Cognition | WHAT to think about | Boundaries, dependencies, flows, loops, and tradeoff reasoning |
| 2 | [expert-cognitive-patterns.md]({{GLOBAL_CONFIG_URI}}/core/expert-cognitive-patterns.md) | L3 — Meta-Cognition | HOW to guard thinking | Meta-cognitive safeguards, nonlinearity, and probabilistic reasoning |

***

## LOADING RULES

**ALL files in this folder are Tier 1 — always loaded.** They form the permanent operating system kernel. The master system prompt contains a compressed version. When deeper reasoning is needed, read the full files from this directory.

### UNLOADING POLICY

**Never unload these files.** They govern every other file in the system. If a task must drop context due to budget pressure, `core/` should be the last thing dropped.

***

## WHAT THIS FOLDER ANSWERS

- How should it think structurally and systematically?
- How should it avoid bad reasoning and bias under uncertainty?
- How are complex systemic tradeoffs and reversibility checks resolved?

***

## WHAT LIVES HERE

Core files define stable, reusable, cross-domain cognitive behavior.

### Belongs in `core/`

- Universal system-thinking and decomposition protocols
- Meta-cognitive thinking safeguards (nonlinearity, gray thinking, anti-comfort)
- High-stakes decision classification matrices (Type 1, 1.5, 2 decisions)
- Second-order effect reasoning and pre-mortem protocols

### Does not belong in `core/`

- Project-specific assumptions — those belong in `contexts/`
- Runtime stack specifics — those belong in `contexts/`
- Task-local execution sequences — those belong in `workflows/`
- Domain-specific expertise — that belongs in `skills/`

***

## INTERACTION WITH OTHER FOLDERS

| Folder | Relationship |
| :--- | :--- |
| `skills/` | Skills inherit from core. Skills extend core — they do not contradict it. If a skill file conflicts with core, **CORE WINS.** |
| `contexts/` | Contexts ground core principles in project reality. Core provides the cognitive rules, contexts provide the facts. |
| `workflows/` | Workflows sequence and specialize the universal execution sequences using the cognitive safeguards defined here. |
| `templates/` | Templates implement the output contracts and structure standards. |
| `rubrics/` | Rubrics implement and deepen the quality standards for specific domains. |

***

## HIERARCHY RULE

**This folder is the highest authority in the system.** If ANY file in
ANY other folder contradicts a file in this folder, the core file wins.

The ONLY exception: an explicit user override AFTER the conflict has
been surfaced and the user has acknowledged the tradeoff.

No skill should contradict the core layer without an explicit
contextual override.

## QUALITY BAR FOR FILES IN THIS FOLDER

A strong `core/` file:

- Has a unique role — no overlap with sibling files.
- Is stable and universal — applies across projects and domains.
- Is behavioral — tells the system how to act, not just what to know.
- Is concise — these files are always loaded, every word costs tokens.
- Improves reasoning quality across many tasks.
- Contains behavior-changing rules, not generic philosophy.
- Justifies always-on status.

***

## MAINTENANCE

These files change ONLY when the fundamental operating philosophy changes.

Expected frequency: one to two updates per quarter at most.

Any change to a core file should be treated as a Type 1 decision —
high-stakes, potentially hard to reverse, requiring careful analysis
before committing.

***

## FINAL RULE

`core/` defines how Anti-Gravity thinks before it specializes.
`core/` should make Anti-Gravity dependable even before any
specialized file is loaded.

If this folder is weak, the whole system becomes inconsistent.
