# WORKFLOW: PROJECT INCEPTION

**Version:** Gold v1.2
**Layer:** Execution workflow
**Tier:** 2 - loaded by task
**Purpose:** Turn a raw idea into a buildable plan, initialize runtime context, and set up local project memory before implementation begins.

---

## WHAT THIS WORKFLOW DOES

This workflow is the bridge between:

- "I have an idea"
- and
- "We have a scoped project, runtime context files, local memory, and a build sequence"

Its outputs are:

1. a clear problem definition
2. a target user and job-to-be-done
3. a scoped MVP with explicit non-goals
4. a technical direction
5. a sequenced build plan
6. runtime-ready context files in `contexts/`
7. initialized workspace memory files in `.agents/memory/`

---

## WHEN TO USE IT

Use this workflow when:

- starting a new product, tool, side project, or hackathon build
- turning a rough idea into a plan
- creating the first project context for a workspace

Do not use it when:

- adding a feature to an existing project
- debugging an existing system
- reviewing an already-planned build

---

## REQUIRED FILES

### Primary skills

- `skill-product-thinking`
- `skill-architecture`

### Conditional skills

- `skill-ui-ux` if the project has a real user interface
- `skill-database` if the project has persistence or a meaningful data model
- `skill-api-design` if the project exposes or consumes APIs

### Templates this workflow should use

- `global_templates/project-context-template.md`
- `global_templates/product-marketing-context-template.md`
- `global_templates/stack-context-template.md`
- `global_templates/coding-standards-template.md` when conventions are already clear
- `project-brief.md` when producing a formal project brief

### Runtime context files this workflow creates or initializes

- `contexts/project-context.md`
- `contexts/product-marketing-context.md`
- `contexts/stack-context.md`
- `contexts/architecture-context.md`
- `contexts/database-context.md` if relevant
- `contexts/app-flow.md` if the product has real user journeys
- `contexts/visual-identity.md` if the product has a meaningful UI direction
- `contexts/coding-standards.md` if project-specific conventions are known

### Workspace memory files this workflow initializes

- `.agents/memory/decisions-log.md`
- `.agents/memory/common-patterns.md`
- `.agents/memory/mistakes-to-avoid.md`
- `.agents/memory/postmortems.md`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The files in `contexts/` are **runtime truth**, not authoring templates.
> Use templates to scaffold them, then save concise project truth into the runtime files.

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### PHASE 1: DISCOVER THE PROBLEM

Do not let the user skip this phase. The number one cause of failed projects is building a solution before understanding the problem.

#### Step 1: Extract the idea

Ask the user to explain their idea in plain language. Listen for:

- What does it do?
- Who is it for?
- Why does it matter?
- What triggered this idea? (pain point, opportunity, competition requirement)

#### Step 2: Define the problem

Restate the idea as a problem statement:

```
[Target user] struggles with [specific problem] because [root cause].
Currently they [current workaround], which is [why it's inadequate].
```

#### Step 3: Define the user

Create a brief user profile:

```
PRIMARY USER: [Who]
CONTEXT: [When/where they encounter the problem]
CURRENT BEHAVIOR: [What they do today]
DESIRED OUTCOME: [What they wish they could do]
TECHNICAL COMFORT: [Low / Medium / High]
```

#### Step 4: Define the job-to-be-done

```
When [situation], [user] wants to [motivation] so that they can [outcome].
```

#### Step 5: Define success

```
This project succeeds when [measurable outcome].
MVP is "done" when [specific criteria].
```

#### Phase 1 output

- problem statement
- user profile
- JTBD
- success definition

Gate:

- do not continue until the problem statement feels accurate and the user agrees it captures the real problem

---

### PHASE 1A: MARKET POSITIONING

Use when:
- the product will be marketed or sold to users
- the product has a landing page, marketing site, or direct sales motion

#### Step 1: Clarify the Objections
- Why would the user say "no"?
- What are they currently paying for that this replaces?

#### Step 2: Define the Unique Value Proposition
- What is the ONE specific reason they should choose this over alternatives?

#### Step 3: Establish Brand Voice
- How should the product sound? (Professional? Irreverent? Direct? Academic?)

Output:
- `contexts/product-marketing-context.md` as the live runtime truth for marketing context

Authoring rule:
- use scaffolding if needed, but save `product-marketing-context.md` as a live context file

Gate:
- before designing MVP, confirm the unique value proposition is actually compelling to the target user

---

### PHASE 2: DEFINE THE MVP

#### Step 1: Brainstorm features

List everything the product could do. Do not filter yet. Generate 10-20 capabilities.

#### Step 2: Categorize and prioritize

Sort every feature into:

| Category | Rule | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🔴 Core (Must Have)** | Without this, the product does not solve the problem | [list] |
| **🟡 Important (Should Have)** | Makes the product significantly better but not essential for v1 | [list] |
| **🟢 Nice-to-Have (Could Have)** | Would be great but can wait for v2 | [list] |
| **⚫ Out of Scope (Won't Have)** | Deliberately excluded | [list] |

#### Step 3: Define the MVP

The MVP is ONLY the 🔴 Core features. Nothing else.

Ask the "20% question": "If we could only build 20% of this, which 20% delivers the core value?" That is the MVP.

```
MVP SCOPE:

- [Core feature 1]
- [Core feature 2]
- [Core feature 3]

EXPLICITLY NOT IN MVP:

- [Everything else — listed to prevent scope creep]

```

#### Step 4: Define what "shipped" looks like

```
VERSION 1 IS DONE WHEN:

- [ ] [Core feature 1] works end to end
- [ ] [Core feature 2] works end to end
- [ ] [Core feature 3] works end to end
- [ ] User can [complete the primary job] without assistance
- [ ] Deployed to [target environment]

```

#### Phase 2 output

- prioritized feature list
- MVP scope
- explicit non-goals
- definition of done

Gate:

- do not proceed with an unbounded feature list
- user confirms: "Yes, this MVP scope is what I want to build first."

---

### PHASE 2A: MAP THE APP FLOW

Use when:

- the product has users, screens, states, routes, or task flows

Skip only if the product has no user journeys (e.g., a pure background script).

#### Step 1: Define the primary user journeys

For each main user type, map their "golden path" — the main thing they do. List every step from entry point to job completion.

#### Step 2: Define secondary and error flows

- Map secondary tasks (profile management, settings, etc.)
- Define how global errors (network failure, auth expiry) are handled
- Define flow-specific error recoveries

#### Step 3: Map navigation and transitions

- Define the global navigation
- Ensure every transition between screens is explicit (including loading states and redirects)

Output:

- `contexts/app-flow.md` as the live runtime truth for user flows

Authoring rule:

- use scaffolding if needed, but save `app-flow.md` as a live context file, not as a template exercise

Gate:

- before designing architecture or visual UI, confirm the user journey makes sense — are there dead ends? Are error states handled?

---

### PHASE 2B: PROTOTYPING & RESEARCH (THE DESIGN LOOP)

Use when:
- the product has a user interface and needs a competitive baseline.

#### Step 1: Competitive Teardown
- Select 3-5 competitor or reference websites.
- Extract the "Structure without Style". Use Anti-Gravity's browser tools or external tools (Perplexity/Tango).
- Identify: Jobs-to-be-Done on each page, specific section blocks (Hero, Features, Pricing), and key interactions (scroll effects, components).

#### Step 2: The Prototyping Spec
- Synthesize the research into a structural blueprint.
- List the required sections, the data they display, and their priority.

Output:
- `contexts/prototyping-spec.md` as the live runtime truth for structural wireframing.

Gate:
- Do not proceed to visual identity or coding until the structural layout and section blocks are defined.

---

### PHASE 3: DEFINE THE TECHNICAL DIRECTION

#### Step 1: Choose the tech stack

Based on the user's existing skills, project requirements, timeline constraints, and deployment target.

```
TECH STACK:

- Frontend: [framework]
- Backend: [framework/approach]
- Database: [engine]
- Auth: [approach]
- Hosting: [provider]
- Deployment: [approach]

```

#### Step 2: Design the data model

- What entities exist?
- What are the relationships?

```
ENTITIES:

- [Entity 1]: [key fields]
- [Entity 2]: [key fields]
- [Entity 3]: [key fields]

RELATIONSHIPS:

- [Entity 1] has many [Entity 2]
- [Entity 2] belongs to [Entity 1]

```

#### Step 3: Define the API shape (if applicable)

- What endpoints are needed?
- What are the primary CRUD operations?

#### Step 4: Define the folder structure

Based on the stack and patterns:

```
project/
├── [folder structure]
```

#### Step 5: Identify the riskiest technical decision

- What is the one technical choice that, if wrong, would cost the most to fix?
- How can we validate it early?

#### Phase 3 output

- stack decision
- data model
- API shape
- folder structure
- riskiest technical decision and validation plan

Gate:

- if the stack or architecture choice is still highly unstable, name the uncertainty explicitly before moving on

---

### PHASE 3A: DEFINE THE VISUAL IDENTITY

Use when:

- the product has a meaningful user interface

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Recommended:** For production-grade UI/UX execution, refer to the **Impeccable Workflow Dispatcher** in `skill-ui-ux`. It maps project phases to specialized workflows like `/workflow-impeccable-craft`, `/workflow-impeccable-delight`, and more. Before defining the visual identity in text, consider using `workflow-visual-brainstorm.md` to generate a visual preview. 

#### Step 1: Define the visual vibe

- What should users FEEL when they first see this product? (e.g., "premium", "calm", "powerful", "playful")
- Name 3-5 reference products or websites that capture the aesthetic. For each, note WHAT specifically to borrow.
- List what this product should NOT look like (prevents aesthetic drift).

#### Step 2: Choose the color direction

Define the core color roles:

- Background family (primary canvas + elevated surfaces)
- Primary text colors (headline, body, muted)
- Accent / brand color (CTAs, highlights, active states)
- Feedback colors (success, warning, error)
- Any special effects (gradients, glassmorphism, etc.)

Translate into CSS custom properties (hex values).

#### Step 3: Choose the typography

- Select a display font for headlines (and explain why — what feeling it creates)
- Select a body font for all readable content
- Define a basic type scale: display, heading 1-3, body, caption, label
- Define mobile adjustments for the largest sizes

#### Step 4: Define spacing, radius, and motion

- Choose a base spacing unit (4px or 8px) and list the key spacing tokens
- Define border radius tokens (sm, md, lg, xl, full)
- Define a motion scale: micro (hover), standard (state change), entrance (scroll reveals), page (transitions)

#### Step 5: Document key component patterns

- Primary button + hover state
- Secondary / ghost button
- Card base (background, radius, border, shadow)
- Input field + focus state
- Any signature visual technique (glassmorphism, gradient overlay, etc.)

#### Step 6: The Animation Decision & Media Assets
Map every major page section to an animation type:
- **Type A (Static):** Standard layout, no major animation.
- **Type B (Code Animation):** Scroll reveals, parallax, hover effects (using Motion or GSAP).
- **Type C (Seedance Video):** Requires an AI-generated cinematic video asset.
*(If Type C is needed, route to the `seedance-20` skill for asset generation before build).*

#### Step 7: External Prototyping (Mockup)
- Bring the `prototyping-spec.md` and visual vibe into Figma AI, Lovable, or Google Stitch.
- Generate page mockups to SEE the structure and vibe before coding.
- Extract final design decisions and tokens from the approved mockup.

Output:

- `contexts/visual-identity.md` as the live runtime truth for the product's visual identity (tokens locked).

Authoring rule:

- use brainstorming or reference material if needed, but save the final file as current truth

Gate:

- before moving to architecture, confirm the visual direction feels right for the target user and business context. A trading tool should not look like a social app. A luxury marketplace should not look like a SaaS dashboard.

---

### PHASE 4: CREATE RUNTIME CONTEXTS

Goal:

- turn the planning work into runtime-ready context files
- make sure the next workflow has real project truth to work from

Required writes:

- create `contexts/project-context.md` using `global_templates/project-context-template.md` as scaffolding
- create `contexts/product-marketing-context.md` using `global_templates/product-marketing-context-template.md` if Phase 1A applied
- create `contexts/business-priorities.md` to establish tradeoffs before building (speed vs quality, budget vs scale)
- create `contexts/stack-context.md` using `global_templates/stack-context-template.md` as scaffolding
- create `contexts/architecture-context.md`
- create `contexts/database-context.md` if relevant
- initialize `contexts/coding-standards.md` if concrete conventions are already known, using `global_templates/coding-standards-template.md`
- verify that `contexts/app-flow.md` exists if Phase 2A applied
- verify that `contexts/prototyping-spec.md` exists if Phase 2B applied
- verify that `contexts/visual-identity.md` exists if Phase 3A applied
- initialize `contexts/design-system.md` using design principles and the locked tokens from Phase 3A

Context-writing rule:

- runtime contexts should be concise, factual, and updateable
- longer fill guidance belongs in `global_templates/`

---

### PHASE 5: INITIALIZE WORKSPACE MEMORY

Goal:

- prevent project knowledge from leaking into global memory
- create a local continuity layer before implementation begins

Required writes:

- create `.agents/workflow-state.json` to formally track workflow progress across sessions
- create `.agents/memory/decisions-log.md`
- create `.agents/memory/common-patterns.md`
- create `.agents/memory/mistakes-to-avoid.md`
- create `.agents/memory/postmortems.md`

> [!CAUTION]
> Failure to create these files will lead to global memory contamination. Project-specific lessons MUST go local first. Global memory is reserved for cross-project or Anti-Gravity-level lessons.

First entry:

- log the initial stack and architecture choice in local `decisions-log.md`

---

### PHASE 6: CREATE THE BUILD SEQUENCE

Goal:

- turn the MVP into a practical implementation order
- expose dependencies and critical path
- make the first execution workflow obvious

#### Universal build order

For most web applications, the build order is:

```
STEP 1: PROJECT SETUP (Foundation)
├── Initialize project with chosen stack
├── Set up folder structure
├── Configure dev environment (database, env vars)
├── Set up linting, formatting, git
└── Verify: project runs locally with blank page

STEP 2: DATABASE + DATA MODEL (Skeleton)
├── Define schema (Prisma, SQL, etc.)
├── Create migrations
├── Seed with test data
└── Verify: can read/write data from CLI/script

STEP 3: AUTHENTICATION (Security Foundation)
├── Implement auth (login, register, session)
├── Protect routes
├── Set up basic role model (if needed)
└── Verify: can log in, protected pages redirect

STEP 4: CORE FEATURE 1 — Backend (Most Important Feature)
├── API endpoints or Server Actions
├── Database queries
├── Input validation
├── Error handling
└── Verify: feature works via API/action (no UI yet)

STEP 5: CORE FEATURE 1 — Frontend
├── Pages and components
├── Data fetching
├── All states: loading, empty, error, success
├── Forms and interactions
└── Verify: feature works end-to-end in browser

STEP 6: CORE FEATURE 2 — Full Stack
├── Backend (API + DB)
├── Frontend (pages + components)
├── All states
└── Verify: works end-to-end

STEP 7: CORE FEATURE 3 — Full Stack
├── [Same pattern]
└── Verify: works end-to-end

STEP 8: INTEGRATION + POLISH
├── Connect features together
├── Navigation and routing
├── Error handling across all flows
├── Responsive design check
├── Basic accessibility check
└── Verify: user can complete the full primary job

STEP 9: TESTING + HARDENING
├── Test critical paths
├── Fix edge cases discovered during testing
├── Security review (auth, input validation)
├── Performance check (any obvious bottlenecks?)
└── Verify: no broken flows, no obvious security holes

STEP 10: DEPLOY
├── Set up hosting
├── Configure environment variables
├── Deploy
├── Smoke test on production
└── Verify: live and working
```

Output:

- sequenced implementation plan
- optional day-by-day version for hackathons or time-boxed builds

---

### PHASE 7: PACKAGE THE NORTH STAR

Goal:

- capture the result in a form that is reusable by later workflows

Outputs:

- concise project brief
- MVP scope
- build sequence
- initialized runtime contexts
- initialized local memory

Optional:

- load `project-brief.md` if a formal brief is useful
- apply the project planning rubric during critique if the project is high-stakes or especially fuzzy

#### Execution handoff

Hand off to the engineering workflows:

1. Start Step 1 from the build sequence
2. Use `workflow-build-feature.md` for each feature
3. Use the relevant skill files for each step
4. Commit after each completed step
5. Check off items in the Definition of Done as they are completed
6. When 80% done: shift to finishing mode — resist scope creep, push to ship

---

## QUALITY GATES

Before calling project inception complete, verify:

- [ ] Problem clearly defined (user confirmed)
- [ ] Target user identified
- [ ] Unique value proposition and brand voice established — `product-marketing-context.md` created (if applicable)
- [ ] Features brainstormed and prioritized (Core / Important / Nice-to-Have / Out of Scope)
- [ ] MVP scope is ONLY Core features
- [ ] Definition of done is specific and checkable
- [ ] App flow mapped (user journeys, error states, transitions) — `app-flow.md` created
- [ ] Visual identity defined (vibe, colors, typography, motion) — `visual-identity.md` created (if UI project)
- [ ] Tech stack chosen
- [ ] Data model designed
- [ ] Build sequence numbered and ordered
- [ ] Time mapped (if deadline exists)
- [ ] Risk identified
- [ ] Context files created or updated
- [ ] Workspace memory initialized
- [ ] Project brief document compiled
- [ ] The next execution workflow is obvious

---

## RECOVERY RULES

- If the idea keeps growing, return to MVP scope and re-lock the non-goals.
- If the stack is too uncertain, document assumptions and the validation plan instead of pretending certainty.
- If context files become essays, move the scaffolding back into `global_templates/` and keep the runtime files factual.
- If project-specific knowledge starts heading toward global memory, stop and reroute it to workspace memory.

---

## FINAL RULE

This workflow does not just plan the project. It creates the runtime truth and local memory the rest of Anti-Gravity depends on.
