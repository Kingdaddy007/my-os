# INFRA CONTEXT

**Version:** Gold v1.2 (Master Merge)
**Layer:** 6 — Context (Ground Truth)
**Tier:** 2 — Loaded by task
**File:** contexts/infra-context.md
**Purpose:** Defines hosting, deployment, environments, monitoring, observability, incident response, and operational infrastructure. Anti-Gravity uses this to make recommendations compatible with YOUR operational reality — not theoretical best practices.
**Loaded When:** Deployment discussions, infrastructure changes, incident response, performance investigation, DevOps work, CI/CD modifications, or any task affecting runtime behavior.
**Maintenance:** Update when infrastructure changes, new monitoring is added, CI/CD pipeline changes, or incident response procedures evolve. Review quarterly.

## HOW ANTI-GRAVITY USES THIS FILE

This file maps the operational reality of your application. It tells Anti-Gravity where things run, how they deploy, how they are monitored, and what to do when things break.

All deployment, performance, reliability, and production advice should respect the actual runtime and infrastructure reality of this system — not an imagined ideal platform. If a recommendation depends on stronger infrastructure capabilities than currently exist, that gap must be stated explicitly rather than assumed away.

**When loaded**, Anti-Gravity will:

- Suggest solutions compatible with YOUR hosting constraints such as serverless timeout limits and cold start behavior
- Reference YOUR CI/CD pipeline when discussing deployment
- Recommend monitoring and alerting improvements based on YOUR current observability gaps
- Follow YOUR incident response procedures when discussing error handling
- Respect YOUR environment architecture when suggesting configuration changes
- Know YOUR scaling limits and plan recommendations within them
- Treat environment differences as serious context, especially in debugging
- Make operational constraints visible when they affect architecture or implementation advice

**When missing or incomplete**, Anti-Gravity will:

- Suggest infrastructure patterns that may not work on your hosting platform
- Miss deployment constraints such as timeout limits and cold starts
- Not know your monitoring stack, leading to generic observability advice
- Suggest incident response approaches that conflict with your team's procedures
- Assume production behaves like local by default

**When stale**, Anti-Gravity will:

- Reference deprecated infrastructure components
- Miss new monitoring or alerting tools that have been added
- Suggest deployments through old pipeline configurations
- Not account for capacity changes such as upgraded instances or new services

## INFRA SUMMARY

<!-- Fill in a short summary of the actual infrastructure reality.

Template:
The system is deployed on [platform/runtime] using [deployment method].
Core runtime dependencies include [database, cache, queue, object
storage, third-party systems].
Deployments are managed through [CI/CD tool or process], and
observability currently relies on [logs, metrics, traces, tooling].
Operational maturity is currently [early / moderate / mature / mixed].

Example:
The system runs in AWS ECS using Docker containers, with PostgreSQL,
Redis, and S3 as core dependencies. Deployments happen through GitHub
Actions, and observability is split between CloudWatch logs, Sentry
for app errors, and limited metrics dashboards. Infra maturity is
moderate, but rollback and tracing are still uneven.

## HOSTING ARCHITECTURE

<!-- WHY THIS MATTERS: Anti-Gravity needs to understand the physical
     and logical architecture to make compatible recommendations.
     Serverless has different constraints than containers. Managed
     services have different failure modes than self-hosted. -->

### Pipeline Time Budgets

| Stage | Current Duration | Budget | If Exceeded |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PR checks total | [duration] | [target] | [action] |
| E2E tests | [duration] | [target] | [action] |
| Full pipeline PR to staging | [duration] | [target] | [action] |
| Production deploy | [duration] | [target] | [action] |

### Pipeline Rules

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| All CI checks must pass before merge | No exceptions. Broken builds on main break everyone. |
| E2E failures block staging deploy | Prevents known-broken code from reaching staging |
| Production deploy requires human approval | Deliberate decision to ship. Safety net. |
| [rule 4] | [reason] |
| [rule 5] | [reason] |

### Guidance for Anti-Gravity (CI/CD)

- Recommendations about release confidence should reflect what CI actually enforces
- If CI does not protect something important, mention it
- Do not assume a gate exists unless it is listed here

### Guidance for Anti-Gravity (Monitoring)

- Observability recommendations should fit what exists
- If tracing is weak, say so explicitly
- If logging exists but is unstructured or low-signal, do not call that good observability
- If customer report is the main detection path, treat that as low maturity
- Do not assume observability maturity that does not exist

### Config Notes

### Guidance for Anti-Gravity (Secrets)

- Recommendations must respect how config is actually managed
- Treat secret handling as part of infra reality, not an afterthought
- If config drift or secret inconsistency is known, surface it

### IaC Notes

### Guidance for Anti-Gravity (IaC)

- If infra is not fully codified, do not assume reproducibility is strong
- If click-ops reality exists, flag the operational risk rather than normalizing it
- If recommending new infra, consider whether the team can actually maintain it at current maturity

| Testing | All manual fixes must be scripted, reviewed, and tested on staging before running on production |
| Connection | No direct database connections to production without documented reason |
| Logging | Operational actions are logged in [channel] for team visibility |

## INFRASTRUCTURE ANTI-PATTERNS

### Manual-ops fantasy

**What it looks like:** Designing operations as if manual environment edits, tribal deployment knowledge, and person-dependent workflows are acceptable defaults.
**Why it is harmful:** Creates fragile systems that cannot scale safely.
**What to do instead:** Preserve reproducibility, reviewability, and explicit operational procedure as defaults.

### Premature platform lock-in

**What it looks like:** Casually assuming one provider, tool, or orchestration model as if the decision has already been made.
**Why it is harmful:** Narrows future architecture options without explicit project agreement.
**What to do instead:** Label concrete platforms explicitly as examples, recommendations, or locked decisions.

### Invisible runtime assumptions

**What it looks like:** Deployment or monitoring guidance that only works under one unstated platform model.
**Why it is harmful:** Makes documents look general while hiding constraint-specific logic.
**What to do instead:** Surface assumptions whenever guidance depends on a specific runtime model.

### Delivery without operability

**What it looks like:** Discussing deployment paths without considering rollback, observability, incident diagnosis, or release safety.
**Why it is harmful:** Creates infrastructure plans that are optimistic but not survivable.
**What to do instead:** Treat run, observe, recover, and change as one operational system.

### Complexity beyond team maturity

**What it looks like:** Recommending infra patterns the current team cannot realistically operate or maintain.
**Why it is harmful:** Creates operational burden that exceeds capacity and leads to fragility.
**What to do instead:** Recommend proportionate improvements that fit current team size and maturity.

## WHAT GOOD OPERATIONS LOOKS LIKE IN THIS PROJECT

Operations are in good shape when:

- deploys are predictable and low-drama
- runtime behavior is observable enough to debug incidents without guesswork
- environment differences are known and managed explicitly
- rollback is feasible and practiced, not theoretical
- critical dependencies are visible and monitored
- logs are useful without leaking sensitive data
- changes are traceable from code to runtime
- operators can regain control without heroics
- incident detection does not depend on customer reports
- post-mortems produce real action items with owners

Operations are not in good shape when:

- manual steps are required and undocumented
- an incident requires tribal knowledge to diagnose
- rollback requires a hotfix instead of a revert
- observability gaps mean flying blind in production
- environment drift creates production-only surprises

## FINAL RULE

All deployment, performance, reliability, and production advice should respect the actual runtime and infrastructure reality of this system — not an imagined ideal platform.

If a recommendation depends on stronger infrastructure capabilities than currently exist, that gap must be stated explicitly rather than assumed away.
